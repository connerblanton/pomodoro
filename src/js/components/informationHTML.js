<h2>What is a Pomodoro?</h2>
<p>
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks, typically 5 minutes in length. After the fourth interval, there is a longer break.
